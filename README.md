Sales Insights Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the Sales Insights Data Analysis Project repository! This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a fictional company to provide valuable insights and visualize key metrics using Power BI. The data is sourced from a MySQL database and transformed into readable content for analysis.

Overview
In this project, we utilize SQL queries to extract sales data from the MySQL database of the company. We then employ various data manipulation techniques such as cleaning, filtering, and creating new columns to prepare the data for readable analysis. Once the data is transformed, we leverage Power BI to create insightful visualizations and dashboards.

Repository Structure

data/: This directory contains the MySQL database file (myfile.sql) used for the analysis. It also includes any other relevant data files.
scripts/: This directory contains SQL scripts(Scripts.md) used to extract and manipulate data from the MySQL database.
visualizations/: This directory contains exports of the visualizations and dashboards(Sales Dashboard.pbix) created using Power BI.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and other relevant information.
Setup

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/JatinSBisht/Sales-Insights-Dashboard.git
Install Power BI Desktop on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it here.

Import the myfile.sql database into your MySQL environment.

Open Power BI Desktop and connect to your MySQL database to import the necessary tables for analysis.

Open the Power BI project file (sales_insights.pbix) located in the visualizations/ directory to view the visualizations and dashboards.
